## Intro to Gatsby

**The ‚Äúwhy‚Äù**: Love React? But need something a little more SEO friendly? Or maybe you don‚Äôt need a full-on web app, but still want to build your website with the tooling that the React ecosystem provides?

Gatsby is the solution.

In this talk, we will showcase some of the many features of Gatsby.js.

‚ÄúGatsby is a free and open source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps‚Äù
